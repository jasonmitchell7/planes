# Planes!

Planes is a simple game written in Unity 4.6 using C#. With this version, Unity release their new GUI library. I wanted to see how useful this would be, not just for creating menus, but also as the primary driver of a 2D graphics game. It ended up being extremely useful for this, and subsequently led to me creating a project to promote a band's upcoming album with the same principles.
